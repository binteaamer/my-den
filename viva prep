Libraries:
#include <stdio.h>: This is the Standard Input-Output header file. It provides functions like printf and scanf that are used for input and output operations.

#include <stdlib.h>: The Standard Library header provides utility functions like rand(), srand(), and system(). Here, rand() is used to generate random numbers for placing items on the grid, and system("cls") is used to clear the screen (specific to Windows).

#include <time.h>: This library is used for working with time and date. It provides functions like time() which is used for calculating the game duration.

#include <conio.h>: This is a console input-output library specific to some older compilers (such as Turbo C or Borland C++), and it allows functions like _getch() which is used to capture a single character from the user input.

#include <windows.h>: This header provides functions for interacting with the Windows operating system. In this case, it's used for Sleep() which pauses the program execution for a specified time interval (in milliseconds). It is used here to create a delay between screen refreshes.

Macros:
#define GRID_SIZE 10: This macro defines the size of the grid, which is a 10x10 grid in this game.

#define COINS_COUNT 3: This macro defines the number of coins that will be randomly placed on the grid at the start of the game. In this case, 3 coins are placed.

#define OBSTACLES_COUNT 4: This macro defines the number of obstacles that will be randomly placed on the grid. In this case, 4 obstacles are placed.

#define GAME_DURATION 30: This defines the total game time duration in seconds. The game will last for 30 seconds before it ends.

#define REFRESH_RATE 100: This macro defines how often the game screen will be refreshed. The value 100 indicates that the game will update every 100 milliseconds.

#define EMPTY '.': This macro represents an empty cell in the grid, denoted by a period (.).

#define PLAYER 'P': This macro represents the player character, denoted by the letter P.

#define COIN 'C': This macro represents a coin in the game, denoted by the letter C.

#define OBSTACLE 'X': This macro represents an obstacle, denoted by the letter X.

Functions:
void clearScreen():

Purpose: Clears the console screen. It uses the system("cls") function which is specific to Windows to clear the screen.
Why: This is done to refresh the game view after each move to show the updated game state.
void initializeGrid():

Purpose: Initializes the grid by setting all cells to the EMPTY character (.).
Why: Before the game starts, the grid needs to be empty to ensure that the player, coins, and obstacles can be placed without interference.
int isPositionEmpty(int x, int y):

Purpose: Checks if a specific position on the grid is empty (.).
Why: This function is useful to check whether a randomly generated coordinate is available to place items like coins and obstacles without overlapping with other entities.
void placeRandomItems(char item, int count):

Purpose: Places count number of the specified item (either coin or obstacle) at random empty positions on the grid.
Why: This function randomly places coins or obstacles on the grid at the start of the game or after the player collects a coin. It uses a loop that continues generating random coordinates until an empty spot is found for each item.
void initializeGame():

Purpose: Initializes the game state by setting up the grid, placing the player at the starting position, placing coins and obstacles, and setting the start time.
Why: This function is called at the start of the game to initialize all the necessary components, including the grid, score, and timer.
void displayGame():

Purpose: Displays the current game state to the console, including the score, remaining lives, time left, and the grid.
Why: This function is called in each iteration of the game loop to update and refresh the player's view of the game state.
void handleCollision(int newX, int newY):

Purpose: Handles the consequences of the player moving to a new position. If the player moves to a coin, the score increases. If the player moves to an obstacle, they lose a life.
Why: This function is crucial to managing the game logic. It ensures that interactions with coins and obstacles are handled correctly. If the player collides with an obstacle, the game either resets the player's position or ends the game if lives are exhausted.
void movePlayer(char direction):

Purpose: Moves the player character based on the input direction (w, a, s, d). The function calculates the new player position and checks if it's a valid move (within bounds). It also handles collisions with coins and obstacles.
Why: This function updates the playerâ€™s position and ensures that the game state reflects the movement. It also handles game mechanics like updating the score or lives.
int main():

Purpose: The main entry point of the program. It initializes the game, enters the game loop, and waits for user input to control the player's movement. The loop continues until the game ends (either due to time running out or losing all lives).
Why: This is the main game loop that runs continuously, updating the game state, taking player input, and rendering the grid.
Game Flow:
Game Initialization: The initializeGame function is called to set up the grid, place the player, coins, and obstacles, and start the game timer.

Game Loop: The main function enters a loop, where the game is updated every REFRESH_RATE milliseconds. The game checks for user input (_getch()), processes movement, and updates the game state by calling functions like movePlayer().

Game Termination: The game will stop either when the player has run out of lives (lives <= 0) or when the game time (GAME_DURATION) has elapsed. The game ends with the final score being displayed.

Preparing for Viva:
Key Concepts:

Grid Representation: Understand how the grid is set up and how entities (player, coins, obstacles) interact with it.
Random Placement: Be ready to explain how items are placed randomly on the grid using rand() and srand().
Collision Handling: Know how collisions with coins and obstacles are handled (updating score, lives, resetting the player).
User Input: Understand how input is taken from the user via _getch() and how movement is processed using WASD keys.
Time Management: Be able to explain the use of time(NULL) to manage the game duration and how the game ends after the set time.
Potential Questions:

How does the game handle boundary conditions when moving the player (e.g., can't move outside the grid)?
How would you extend the game to add new features (e.g., more types of obstacles, power-ups, or levels)?
Why did you use system("cls") and what would you do if the game were cross-platform?
Let me know if you'd like more detailed explanations on any of these points!
